# SEZIONE Hair Studio Demo v3

Reference-led rebuild by Punto Due Studio.

## Canonical production workflow
This repository follows **Punto Due Studio — Demo Generation System v3**.

One **complete page** at a time:

1. start from the repository selected by Manuel;
2. choose one primary real high-end website reference for the page;
3. document the Reference Card;
4. use secondary references only for named sub-problems;
5. source client-owned or properly licensed/free photography before considering generation;
6. implement the full page directly in GitHub;
7. run static, desktop, mobile, accessibility and Lighthouse QA;
8. fix every failure before notifying Manuel;
9. only when fully green, say **YOU CAN DEPLOY THIS PAGE NOW**;
10. Manuel deploys and visually reviews;
11. APPROVED → PAGE LOCKED → next page.

## Deployment authority
ChatGPT does **not** deploy this repository under the current workflow.

Manuel deploys manually only after the current page Quality Gate is green.
